        		<h2>Call 911 now if you are not safe or need immediate medical attention.</h2>
				
			<p2>Our hotline and online chat are staffed 24/7 by Confidential Sexual Violence Advocates who can assist in crisis <br> intervention and provide information and referrals. Our advocates offer support to anyone who has questions or is <br> 
				looking for information about sexual violence. Whether you were assaulted today or many years ago, we are here to help.
				<br> <br> Contact an advocate 24/7 by calling <a href="tel:201-487-2227"><span style="color:#46BFB6;">201-487-2227</span></a> or using our <a href="https://www.ywcabergencounty.org/ywca/start.php"><span style="color:#46BFB6;">online chat</span></a>.
				<br> <br> If you have been sexually assaulted in the last 5 days and may want to pursue prosecution, consider contacting <br> our <a href="https://www.ywcabergencounty.org/ywca/sexual-assault-response-team.php"><span style="color:#46BFB6;">Sexual Assault Response Team (SART)</span></a>.</p2>

			<h2>What to do if you have been sexually assaulted:</h2>
	
			
			<ul>
  				<li>Get to a safe place.<li>
 				<li>Contact someone who can help you and call the healingSPACE hotline at <a href="tel:201-487-2227"><span style="color:#46BFB6;">201-487-2227</span></a>.<li>
 				<li>Do not shower, drink or eat, douche, or change your clothes. These activities destroy important evidence in the event that you decide to prosecute the assailant.<li>
				<li>Get medical attention. You may have hidden injuries and may want to explore options for preventing pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.<li>
				<li>Write down everything that you remember happening, with as much detail as possible. This can help with your own healing process and in any legal action you might decide to take.<li>
